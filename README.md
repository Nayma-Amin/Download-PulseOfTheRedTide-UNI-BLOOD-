# UNI-BLOOD - Pulse of the Red Tide - App

UNI-BLOOD (Pulse of the Red Tide) is a Blood Donation Docial Media App. This app was designed and implemented to bridge the gap between doners and recipeints.
We often struggle to find blood doners when it's urgent, we dug through social medias where people share their desired content and less or urgency. Making the search more time consuming than necessary.
That's where our app comes in handy. This app allows users to find doners within their area, and also the nearest possible avaible doners. The in app messaging makes it easier to contact and shsare information at the users consent.
This app was designed to encourage young generation to step ahead and contribute to humanity without a struggle.
